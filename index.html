                                <p>I have been looking around for a service to upgrade my desktop which was over 6 years
                                    old. Unfortunately this isn't such a common service provided by the more well known
                                    stores on the high street. It's easy to purchase the different components but not so
                                    easy to find a reliable, cost effective installation <span

                                <p class="more-text">Having been looking around the local area I came across
                                    InstantRepairs, who
                                    were not only local with a significant number of good reviews, but also offered home
                                    installation. <br>After contacting them and exchanging messages several times
                                    regarding what I wanted, I decided to go ahead. InstantRepairs were very patient and
                                    happy to recommend options and answer any questions. This was before making any
                                    payment - which is a nice touch! <br>The service provided was timely, efficient, and
                                    of high quality. The work went over the estimated timeframe but was not rushed which
                                    provided further reassurance. <br>I would highly recommend InstantRepairs for any
                                    sort of Tech fix / upgrade. 5*****</p>

                                <p>My high-end video editing PC crashed and wouldn't load. Shovon effectively diagnosed
                                    the issue as a faulty GPU by hooking it up to his personal rig and advised I return
                                    it to the manufacturer under warranty. However, due to an urgent deadline, I went
                                    ahead and ordered a new GPU, a new PSU and some extra RAM which Shovon gladly
                                    installed - he even added new thermal paste to the CPU! <span
                                    class="review-dot">...</span></p>

                                <p class="more-text">Shovon then stress-tested the new setup using benchmarking and everything is now
                                    working perfectly. I highly recommend Shovon for his knowledge, professionalism,
                                    communication and trustworthiness; at no point did I feel uncomfortable leaving a
                                    £3,000 PC alone with him. Thank you for saving the project! </p>

                                <p>I have been looking around for a service to upgrade my desktop which was over 6 years
                                    old. Unfortunately this isn't such a common service provided by the more well known
                                    stores on the high street. It's easy to purchase the different components but not so
                                    easy to find a reliable, cost effective installation <span

                                <p class="more-text">Having been looking around the local area I came across
                                    InstantRepairs, who
                                    were not only local with a significant number of good reviews, but also offered home
                                    installation. <br>After contacting them and exchanging messages several times
                                    regarding what I wanted, I decided to go ahead. InstantRepairs were very patient and
                                    happy to recommend options and answer any questions. This was before making any
                                    payment - which is a nice touch! <br>The service provided was timely, efficient, and
